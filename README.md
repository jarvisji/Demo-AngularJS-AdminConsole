# Demo-Angular-AdminConsole

This is one of my historical project, not in maintian now, just for reference, and demo my experience.  It is an administrator console for online shop service. End user may create their shop in minutes by set categories, and goods.

This project is built by AngularJS + Bootstrap, and a simple PHP proxy to resolve cross-domain issue. It consumes a back-end service which exposes RESTful APIs and JSON datas.

Note: I updated some codes, so this project cannot run directly.
